Introduction
================================================================================
**pyexcel-odsw** does write an ods file using constant memory.



Installation
================================================================================
You can get it:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel-odsw.git
    $ cd pyexcel-odsw
    $ python setup.py install



Development guide
================================================================================

Development steps for code changes

#. git clone https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel-odsw.git
#. cd pyexcel-odsw

Upgrade your setup tools and pip. They are needed for development and testing only:

#. pip install --upgrade setuptools pip

Then install relevant development requirements:

#. pip install -r rnd_requirements.txt # if such a file exists
#. pip install -r requirements.txt
#. pip install -r tests/requirements.txt

Once you have finished your changes, please provide test case(s), relevant documentation
and update changelog.yml

.. note::

    As to rnd_requirements.txt, usually, it is created when a dependent
    library is not released. Once the dependency is installed
    (will be released), the future
    version of the dependency in the requirements.txt will be valid.


How to test your contribution
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although `nose` and `doctest` are both used in code testing, it is advisable
that unit tests are put in tests. `doctest` is incorporated only to make sure
the code examples in documentation remain valid across different development
releases.

On Linux/Unix systems, please launch your tests like this::

    $ make

On Windows, please issue this command::

    > test.bat


Before you commit
------------------------------

Please run::

    $ make format

so as to beautify your code otherwise your build may fail your unit test.
